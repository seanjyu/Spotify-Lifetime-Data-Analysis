# spotify_lifetime_data_analysis

The purpose of this code was to gain experience in using pandas functions, namely the plotting, dataframe and slider functions.

'rankVsDate_period_rank_plotlysy.py' will plot the ranking vs time that the song has stayed on the billboard top 100.
'billboardData.csv' is the data used in the code. This data was created from the spotify api.

The average rating is also plotted. The shaded area represents 1 standard deviation above and below the average rank at that given lenght of time on the billboard top 100.

Plots may not show up initially however once the slider is moved data should appear.
