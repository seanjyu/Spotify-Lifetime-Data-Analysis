# spotify_lifetime_data_analysis

The purpose of this code was to gain experience in using pandas and plotly functions, namely the plotting, dataframe and slider functions.

'rankVsDate_period_rank_plotlysy.py' will plot the ranking vs time that the song has stayed on the billboard top 100 for songs that have reached rank 1 at any point in the time of interest.
'billboardData.csv' is the data used in the code. This data was created from the spotify api.

The dates of interest can be changed in the code. The average rating is also plotted. The shaded area represents 1 standard deviation above and below the average rank at that given lenght of time on the billboard top 100.

Plots may not show up initially however once the slider is moved data should appear.

Below is an image of an example plot.
